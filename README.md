# Introduction

I find it more and more necessary for a friendlier testing framework in the .NET universe as my career drives on. While working on Kotlin projects, I came to enjoy writing tests in an easy-to-read fashion using a powerful testing framework called Kotest. What appealed to me the most was that it really didn't feel like I was writing tests. Coming back to .NET, I decided I wanted that same feeling. Tests are important, so it shouldn't feel like a chore! Hence, *notest* was born; The testing framework that doesn't feel like writing tests.

## Key Takeaways

- Writing tests should be as easy as writing acceptance critera
- Reading tests should be as easy as reading acceptance critera
- The framework should accept different styles of test writing, [just like kotest](https://kotest.io/docs/framework/testing-styles.html)
- Since SpecFlow is not getting the support it needs to keep up with .NET's evolution, this should give the same BDD experience
   - [Gherkin language support](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow-gherkin-editor)
   - [Living documentation](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow-livingdoc)
